# Student-Marks-Calculator
This Python script calculates the total marks of a student by summing the marks obtained in six subjects (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) and then computes the average by dividing the sum of the first five subjects plus the sixth subject's marks by 6. The script prompts the user to input the marks for each subject and outputs the calculated result.
